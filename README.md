Power Spectra of Turbulent Galactic Gas (Supervisors: Amr El-Zant and Mahmoud Hashim):

Galaxies contain gas that is energetically driven by various processes, such as mergers and infall of gas onto galaxies, gravitational contraction of gas clouds within galaxies the differential in discs, and supernovae explosions within the clouds. The gaseous interstellar medium, thus driven, is highly turbulent, with Fourier power spectrum showing a scale-invariant power law on a very wide range of scales. The characterization of the density and velocity fluctuations associated with the (compressible) turbulence is important for understanding galaxy formation, structure and evolution,. But its origin is still intensely debated. This is a developing topic, driven by incoming data, of higher resolution and cosmic depth, and ever more sophisticated numerical modelling. Students will work on numerical simulation (and, time permitting) actual data from the state of the art PHANGS survey. Required skills and background: Some knowledge of Python; basic familiarity with Fourier transforms (or at least series); some knowledge of hydrodynamics helpful.
